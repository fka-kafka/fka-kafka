Prior to becoming yet another full-stack developer (YAFD - Patent Pending), 🔭 I’d been exploring the world of computing since since my very first Nokia 3310; I was 3 (You could say I'm a precursor to iPad Kids). When undestanding how to use each new iteration of tools that build upon [**Grace Hopper**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)'s work proved not enough for me, I sought out to undestand how to make new tools from the ideas I saw around me && that formulated in my brain.
<br>

## 💼 What I Do && What I do It with

I specialize in building secure and scallable RESTful APIS, Microservices and web applications from concept to deployment while being passionate about clean architecture, design && user experience, and creating products that users actually enjoy using. 
I also possess the technical competency to evaluate the right tool for the job from the following ever-growing skillset that I have used to build **Full-Stack Applications**, design and develop **RESTful APIs**, create **responsive && performant React applications** with modern tooling and help fellow developers **improve their craft and codebase quality**:   
<br>   
- **Languages:** JavaScript || TypeScript, Python, Go
- **Frameworks:** ReactJS || NextJS, ExpressJS || NestJS, Django && DRF, Gin
- **DevOps & Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Git, CI/CD
- **Other:** RESTful APIs, Microservices, System Design, Testing
<br> 

*Open to freelance projects, consulting, and collaboration opportunities.*

##

In the hunt for even greater depth && proficiency in my craft, I am currently augmenting my skillset with the following:

- 📖 Advanced Kubernetes patterns - Deep diving into orchestration and scaling strategies
- 📖 Microservices architecture - Learning distributed systems design and inter-service communication
- 📖 System design - Building more scalable and resilient applications
