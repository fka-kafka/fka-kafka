## About Me

Prior to becoming yet another full-stack developer (YAFD - Patent Pending), 🔭 I’d been exploring the world of computing since since my very first Nokia 3310; I was 3 (You could say I'm a precursor to iPad Kids). When undestanding how to use each new iteration of tools that build upon [**Grace Hopper**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)'s work proved not enough for me, I sought out to undestand how to make new tools from the ideas I saw around me && that formulated in my brain.
